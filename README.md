**Example Input**:
```
4 5
1 2
1 3
2 3
2 4
3 4

#### 2. **Trenuri (Maximum Cities Path Finder)**
**Input Format**:  
The first line contains two city names, `A` and `B`, representing the start and end cities. The second line contains an integer `n` (number of connections), followed by `n` lines of city connections, each in the format `city1 city2`.

**Example Input**:
```
bucurești timișoara
4
bucurești sibiu
sibiu timișoara
sibiu cluj
cluj timișoara
```
**Expected Output**:  
```

#### 3. **Drumuri (Minimum Cost Multi-Source Paths)**
Given a directed graph with weighted edges and three specific nodes \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), your goal is to find a subset of edges whose total weight is minimized such that:

- There is at least one path starting from node \(x\) and reaching node \(z\)
- There is at least one path starting from node \(y\) and reaching node \(z\)

You need to determine the minimum sum of edge weights for such paths.

**Input Format**:  
- The first line contains two integers \(n\) (number of nodes) and \(m\) (number of edges)
- The following \(m\) lines describe the edges in the format \(u\ v\ w\), where \(u\) and \(v\) are nodes connected by an edge, and \(w\) is the weight of that edge
- The last line contains three integers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), representing the three special nodes in the graph

**Output Format**:
- Output the minimum sum of the weights of edges that satisfy the condition described

**Example Input**:
```
5 7
1 3 6
1 4 5
2 4 6
2 5 5
4 5 5
5 3 2
5 4 5
2 1 3
```
**Expected Output**:  
```
